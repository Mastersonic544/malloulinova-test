## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
These requirements define how the system performs and operates.

### 6.1. Operational Requirements:

OR-001 (Performance): The website must load quickly (target < 2-3 seconds on average connections) to ensure a smooth user experience and positive SEO ranking.

OR-002 (Scalability): The architecture should be scalable to accommodate future growth, additional content (e.g., blog, detailed product pages), and increased traffic without significant re-engineering.

OR-003 (Maintainability): The codebase must be clean, well-documented, and modular to allow for easy updates, bug fixes, and feature additions by future developers.

OR-004 (Security): The website must implement standard security practices (e.g., HTTPS, protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection) to protect data and ensure integrity.

OR-005 (Backup & Recovery): A clear strategy for regular data backups and a recovery plan in case of data loss or system failure.
### 6.2. Technical Requirements:

TR-001 (Responsiveness): The website must be fully responsive and optimized for display across all modern devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), ensuring a consistent experience.

TR-002 (Cross-Browser Compatibility): The website must function correctly and consistently across major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

TR-003 (SEO Optimization): The website must be built with SEO best practices in mind (clean URLs, semantic HTML5, appropriate heading structures, meta tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt) to ensure 
discoverability by search engines.

TR-004 (Analytics Integration): Integration with web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics or a privacy-focused alternative) to track user behavior, traffic sources, and conversion metrics.

TR-005 (Accessibility): The website should aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance where feasible, ensuring it is accessible to users with disabilities.
## 7. Technology Stack (Proposed)
To build a futuristic and intuitive website that aligns with the B2B software development focus and allows for easy maintenance via a CMS, the following technology stack is proposed for implementation in a modern development environment like VS Code:

### 7.1. Frontend:

Framework/Library: React.js (or Next.js for server-side rendering/static site generation benefits) - For building a dynamic, component-based, and highly interactive user interface. This aligns with a "futuristic" feel through smooth transitions and rich interactivity.

Styling:
- Tailwind CSS: For highly customizable, utility-first CSS, enabling rapid development of modern, sleek, and futuristic designs.
- CSS-in-JS (e.g., Styled Components or Emotion): For component-level styling and dynamic themes, supporting the futuristic aesthetic with controlled visual elements.
- Animation Libraries: Framer Motion or GSAP - For sophisticated, smooth, and performance-optimized animations and transitions, crucial for a "futuristic" feel.
- Icons: React Icons or a custom SVG icon set (e.g., from Font Awesome or a custom design).
### 7.2. Backend (for CMS and Data):

- CMS: Strapi (Headless CMS) - Offers a powerful, extensible, and user-friendly admin panel for content management, which can be easily connected to a React/Next.js frontend via API. This meets the CMS requirement directly.
- Database: PostgreSQL (or MongoDB if a NoSQL approach is preferred) - Robust and scalable database solution for storing content managed by Strapi.
- Language/Runtime: Node.js - For running Strapi and any custom API endpoints, leveraging JavaScript across the full stack.
### 7.3. Deployment & Infrastructure:

Hosting:

- Frontend: Vercel (for Next.js) or Netlify (for React SPA) - Provides excellent performance, CDN, and continuous deployment capabilities.
- Backend/CMS: Render, DigitalOcean Droplets, or AWS EC2/Lightsail - For hosting the Strapi instance, offering flexibility and scalability.
- Version Control: Git (hosted on GitHub or GitLab) - Essential for collaborative development and version management.
- Development Environment: VS Code - The preferred IDE for the coding agent, given its extensive extensions for React, Node.js, Git, and other web technologies.
## 8. Design & Aesthetic Guidelines
Overall Aesthetic: Futuristic, clean, and innovative. This implies a focus on clean lines, thoughtful use of space, subtle animations, and potentially dark mode elements with glowing accents.

Color Palette:
- Primary: Dark Blue (for backgrounds, deep sections, conveying stability and technology).
- Secondary/Accent 1: Vibrant Orange (for key CTAs, highlights, interactive elements, conveying energy and innovation).
- Secondary/Accent 2: Black (for text, background details, adding depth and sophistication).
- Complementary: White or very light grey (for primary text, ensuring readability against dark backgrounds).
Inspiration from Telnet Group: The requested inspiration site uses a mix of blue, white, and a touch of orange/red. MALLOULINOVA's palette will be more explicitly blue, orange, and black to lean into the futuristic vibe.

Typography: Modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, Inter, or a custom futuristic font) for headlines and body text to maintain readability and a contemporary feel. Bold typography for headlines.

Imagery & Visuals:
- High-quality, conceptual imagery related to IoT, embedded systems, data, connectivity, and smart environments.
- Abstract, geometric shapes and subtle gradients that evoke technology and forward-thinking.
- Minimal use of stock photos; preference for custom or highly stylized visuals.
Animations & Micro-interactions: Subtle, smooth animations on scroll, hover effects for interactive elements, and transitions between sections to enhance the futuristic feel without being distracting. Parallax scrolling or subtle 3D effects could be considered.
## 9. Future Scope (Out of Scope for initial homepage release)
The following items are recognized as potential future additions but are explicitly out of scope for this initial homepage development phase:

- Dedicated B2C SaaS product homepage.
- Detailed individual service pages (beyond the high-level overview on the homepage).
- Case Studies / Projects section (will be a distinct internal page).
- Blog / News section.
- Careers section.
- Partners section.
- Dedicated "About Us" page (beyond the homepage snippet).
- Client login areas or dashboards.
- Complex forms or calculators.
- Multilingual support (initial focus is English, but architecture should allow for future expansion).
## 10. Development Workflow & Deliverables
- Version Control: All code will be managed using Git, with a repository on GitHub/GitLab.
- Code Quality: Adherence to established coding standards, best practices, and thorough commenting.
- Testing: Basic functional testing to ensure all elements work as expected and responsiveness across devices.
- Deployment: Instructions for deploying the frontend and backend components to the chosen hosting environment.
- Documentation: README.md file in the repository with setup instructions, project structure, and CMS usage guidelines.

This PRD provides a comprehensive roadmap for the development of the MALLOULINOVA homepage. The AI coding agent should use this document as the primary source of truth for implementation.
